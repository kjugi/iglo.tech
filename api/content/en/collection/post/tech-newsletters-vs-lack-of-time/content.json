It&#8217;s really great to have set of most important informations from industry just ready to read on you inbox every week, without paying a single $$$. For me it&#8217;s much better way than digging through Twitter, reading news pages, forums, Github or RSS regularly, because it&#8217;s consuming enormous amounts of time.<\/p>\n<h2>But&#8230; I don&#8217;t have enough time for that!<\/h2>\n<p>Probably you too&#8230; That&#8217;s why I have almost 200 unread newsletters. Will be not so nice to just to throw away all of them, even just because I always found something worth to read inside.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to spend this weekend on reading all of them to have a perfect &#8220;inbox zero&#8221; #perfectWeekend<\/p>\n<p><video autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" muted=\"\"><source src=\"http:\/\/media.gettyimages.com\/videos\/close-up-baboon-wearing-eyeglasses-holding-financial-section-of-and-video-id712-6\" type=\"video\/mp4\" \/><\/video><\/p>\n<h2>What next? How to force myself to read them regularly?<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to post every two weeks a summary of best resources that I read.
