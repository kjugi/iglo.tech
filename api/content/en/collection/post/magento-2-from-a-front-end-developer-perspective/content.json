Unfortunately.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I decide to create this blog &#8211; yeah, it&#8217;s my first post here.<\/p>\n<h2><em>&#8220;What happens? Everybody says M2 is awesome!&#8221;<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>I really like to be honest, even when shouldn&#8217;t, so please have in mind that:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I&#8217;m a developer<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m a front-end guy<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s  just mine point of view<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not official statement of any company<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Magento 2 is huge step forward, especially when it comes to open source part &#8211; moving whole codebase to Github is best what can possibly happened to us.<\/p>\n<p>Overall engine performance was increased, back-end devs says that many things was changed to better solutions and working with 2.x going to be nicer than with 1.x.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230; When it comes to front-end part, unfortunately changes aren&#8217;t looking that good. At the beginning let me try to explain, how different are goals of back-end vs. front-end.<\/p>\n<h3>Goals of front-end dev<\/h3>\n<p>Provide best possible UI and UX to end users. So we should care about:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Implementing design fast and precise<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility with maaaaany browsers<\/li>\n<li>Variety of devices  &#8211; Hardware trends, screen sizes, types of input (touch, mouse, screen readers etc.), performance&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Overall web app performance<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Hardware trends, users and clients expectations, networks speeds and many more factors are changing rapidly through time. That&#8217;s why front-end tools evolves much faster than others.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not into big frameworks (Angular, React etc.), SPAs, ES6, MEAN&#8230; whole &#8220;JavaScript oriented&#8221; world, but care a lot about one thing &#8211; <strong>front-end devs should make front-end using front-end oriented tools<\/strong>, instead of &#8220;weird, limited version of <em>name_of_your_engine_of_choice<\/em> (i.e. Magento) front-end&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In our beautiful, full of not keeping up standards browsers, world of front-end, every year brings a lot of changes changes, thats why people laugh about &#8220;day without new JS framework&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h3>(Possible) Goals of back-end dev<\/h3>\n<p>Create cost effective, rock stable and scalable infrastructure for processing clients data fast and secure. So any rapid changes, just consistent evolution, improving things one by one.<\/p>\n<p>I know that this might be too simplified description, but hey &#8211; I&#8217;m not back-end guy, just want to notice different.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-42 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/iglo.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/1655877_1267887059891336_5563402787800190734_n.jpg\" alt=\"1655877_1267887059891336_5563402787800190734_n\" width=\"650\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https:\/\/iglo.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/1655877_1267887059891336_5563402787800190734_n.jpg 650w, https:\/\/iglo.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/1655877_1267887059891336_5563402787800190734_n-250x244.jpg 250w, https:\/\/iglo.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/1655877_1267887059891336_5563402787800190734_n-120x117.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><i>Summary<\/i><\/h3>\n<p>As you see differences are huge, almost like two separate worlds (connected via API)<\/p>\n<h2>What is wrong with front-end of M2?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Use PHP to build font-end tools<\/li>\n<li>This tools are slooooow and we can&#8217;t extend or customize them, because lack of extensions and our knowledge of PHP<\/li>\n<li>Grunt, LESS, RequireJS, jQuery, Knockout, Prototype and Scriptaculous (yeah, it&#8217;s still here for some reason), LiveReload&#8230; and possibly many more. All of this things are outdated right now, slowly dying or not popular anymore, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You know what really sucks? This things are so damn <strong>deeply integrated with whole Magento and closely unchangeable<\/strong> without hard overrides or creating everything from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s my point<strong> &#8211; Magento 2 font-end looks like designed by back-end devs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><em>&#8220;But you can use whatever you want&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>I dreamed whole life about spending thousands of hours overriding Magento core. Cool. Indeed.
